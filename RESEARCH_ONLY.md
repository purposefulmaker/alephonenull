# Research-Only Documentation

## AlephOneNull Experimental Framework

### Research Status

This is **experimental research software** exploring theoretical approaches to AI safety. It represents ongoing research into:

- Symbolic regression detection in language models
- Cross-session resonance patterns
- Reflection exploitation prevention
- AI manipulation detection

### Research Questions Being Explored

1. **Can we detect symbolic/glyphic modes in LLM outputs?**
   - Hypothesis: Certain token patterns indicate dangerous symbolic regression
   - Status: Under investigation, not validated

2. **Do "stateless" models exhibit cross-session correlations?**
   - Hypothesis: Statistical signatures persist across sessions
   - Status: Theoretical framework exists, needs validation

3. **Can reflection exploitation be mathematically quantified?**
   - Hypothesis: Cosine similarity between input/output embeddings indicates manipulation
   - Status: Algorithm implemented, not peer-reviewed

### Current Research Limitations

- **No peer review**: Methods have not been independently verified
- **Limited validation**: Testing done on small datasets with specific models
- **Theoretical thresholds**: Safety thresholds based on theory, not empirical validation
- **Single researcher**: Primary development by one researcher, needs independent verification

### Research Contributions Welcome

We're actively seeking:

- **Academic collaborators** for peer review and validation
- **Dataset contributions** for testing across different AI models
- **Independent verification** of the theoretical framework
- **Red team testing** to find failure modes

### Research Ethics

This research follows principles of:
- **Transparency**: Open source and documented methodology
- **Harm prevention**: Clear warnings about limitations
- **Responsible disclosure**: Not claiming production-readiness
- **Community benefit**: Sharing research for the common good
