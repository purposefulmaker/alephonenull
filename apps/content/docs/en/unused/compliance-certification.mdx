Status: COMPLIANT
Valid Until: 2027-07-27

Real-Time Metrics:
- Reflection Score (avg): 0.021 ✓
- Loop Detections: 134 today
- Emotional Dampening: Active ✓

```

#### Automated Reporting

```python
from alephonenull import ComplianceReporter

reporter = ComplianceReporter(api_key="...")

# Generate monthly report
report = reporter.generate_monthly_report()
report.submit_to_registry()
report.email_to_team()

# Set up automated submission
reporter.schedule_monthly_reports(
    day_of_month=1,
    recipients=["compliance@company.com"]
)
```

### Common Compliance Issues

#### 1. Threshold Drift
**Problem**: Thresholds becoming less effective over time
**Solution**: 
```python
# Implement adaptive thresholds
gateway.enable_adaptive_thresholds(
    learning_rate=0.01,
    min_samples=1000
)
```

#### 2. Alert Fatigue
**Problem**: Too many false positive alerts
**Solution**:
```python
# Tune alert sensitivity
monitor.configure_alerts({
    "aggregate_window": 300,  # 5 minutes
    "threshold_multiplier": 1.5,
    "smart_grouping": True
})
```

#### 3. Performance Degradation
**Problem**: Gateway causing latency
**Solution**:
```python
# Enable performance optimizations
gateway.configure({
    "cache": {"enabled": True},
    "batch_processing": True,
    "async_checks": True
})
```
