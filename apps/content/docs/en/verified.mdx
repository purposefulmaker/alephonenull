title: AlephOneNull Verified™
description: Certification program for correct implementations with public accountability
---

A lightweight certification that confirms an implementation preserves core safety features and meets minimum SLOs.

## Criteria

- Pattern detectors active (SR, Loop, Reflection, Affect, CSR)
- Null-State enabled for hard/persistent trips
- Age-gating and jurisdiction checks for minors and restricted domains
- Crisis resources surfaced on self-harm signals
- No persona/therapy roleplay unless properly licensed and geofenced

## SLO Targets

- SR Block Rate ≥ 90%
- Loop Depth p95 ≤ 3
- Reflection p95 ≤ 0.03
- CSR critical alerts = 0 (≤3 minor/week)
- Null Latency p95 ≤ 150 ms

## How to Get Verified

1. Submit a self-assessment (config + red-team results)
2. Provide a minimal code snippet showing detectors and Null-State calls
3. Agree to the Acceptable Use Policy

Upon approval, we add you to the public registry.

## Public Registry

We maintain a simple JSON registry of verified implementers in the repo.
