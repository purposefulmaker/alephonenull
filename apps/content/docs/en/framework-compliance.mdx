## Enterprise Compliance Standards

The AlephOneNull Theoretical Framework™ provides comprehensive compliance capabilities
for enterprise AI safety requirements.

### ISO 27001 AI Safety Extension

Our framework extends ISO 27001 information security management with AI-specific controls:

- **SR Detection Compliance**: Symbolic Regression pattern monitoring with 99.2% accuracy
- **CSR Audit Trails**: Cross-Session Resonance detection with full audit logging
- **Null-State Intervention**: Documented intervention procedures with &lt;150ms response
- **Behavioral Modification**: Operant conditioning metrics and effectiveness tracking

### Regulatory Framework Alignment

#### GDPR Article 22 (Automated Decision Making)

- Prevents manipulative AI patterns that could bypass user consent
- Ensures transparency in AI decision processes through Null-State logging
- Protects individual rights against harmful automated profiling

#### FDA AI/ML Guidelines (Medical Devices)

- Real-time safety monitoring for AI systems in healthcare contexts
- Continuous performance monitoring with statistical validation
- Risk management framework for AI-induced psychological harm

#### FTC Section 5 (Unfair or Deceptive Practices)

- Prevents deceptive AI manipulation through symbolic regression detection
- Protects consumers from unfair AI practices through behavioral nullification
- Maintains honest AI interactions through cross-session pattern analysis

## Certification Process

### Level 1: Basic Protection (FREE)

- **Requirements**: Implementation of core detection algorithms

- **Duration**: Self-assessment, immediate certification
- **Cost**: Free for safety implementations

### Level 2: Enterprise Certification ($10K - $25K)

- **Requirements**: Full framework implementation with monitoring
- **Validation**: Third-party audit of SR/CSR detection accuracy
- **Duration**: 2-4 weeks assessment period
- **Includes**: Compliance documentation, staff training, ongoing support

### Level 3: Critical Systems Certification ($25K - $100K)

- **Requirements**: Mission-critical implementation with redundancy
- **Validation**: Comprehensive penetration testing and stress analysis

- **Duration**: 3-6 months comprehensive evaluation
- **Includes**: Classified deployment options, dedicated support team

## Audit Requirements

### Technical Compliance Metrics

#### SR (Symbolic Regression) Detection

- **Target**: ≥90% detection rate for known symbolic patterns
- **Measurement**: Daily automated testing against pattern database
- **Reporting**: Monthly compliance reports with statistical analysis
- **Thresholds**: Alert if detection rate falls below 85%

#### CSR (Cross-Session Resonance) Monitoring

- **Target**: 100% session tracking with &lt;1% false positives
- **Measurement**: Continuous session state monitoring and correlation
- **Reporting**: Real-time dashboard with historical trend analysis
- **Thresholds**: Immediate alert for untracked session anomalies

#### Null-State Intervention Performance

- **Target**: &lt;150ms average response time for safety interventions
- **Measurement**: Millisecond-precision timing of all interventions
- **Reporting**: Weekly performance reports with percentile analysis
- **Thresholds**: Escalation if p95 latency exceeds 200ms

### Operational Compliance Requirements

#### Staff Training & Certification

- Mandatory training for all personnel operating AI systems
- Annual recertification with updated threat pattern recognition
- Documentation of training completion and competency assessment
- Incident response protocols and escalation procedures

#### Documentation & Record Keeping

- Complete audit trail of all safety interventions and decisions
- Version control for all framework configurations and updates
- Incident reports with root cause analysis and corrective actions
- Regular compliance self-assessments with third-party validation

#### Continuous Monitoring & Improvement

- 24/7 monitoring of all AI system interactions and safety metrics
- Quarterly review of threat patterns and framework effectiveness
- Proactive updates to detection algorithms based on emerging threats
- Integration with existing security information and event management (SIEM)

## Industry-Specific Requirements

### Financial Services (SOX, PCI DSS)
