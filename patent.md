📌 Where to Put “Patent Pending”

On your docs & whitepapers:
At the footer or title page →
“Patent Pending — U.S. Provisional Application No. [XXXXXX], filed [MM/DD/YYYY].”
(You can leave out the number if you don’t want to disclose it.)

On your website / GitHub / SDK:
In the README/license:
“AlephOneNull Framework™ — Patent Pending (filed Sept 2025).”

On slide decks / pitch materials:
Bottom corner of slides with logo: Patent Pending

On code headers (optional):

# AlephOneNull Framework
# Patent Pending (Filed Sept 2025)

⚠️ Rules to Remember

You can’t use “patented” yet — only “Patent Pending.”

If you let the provisional expire (12 months) without filing a non-provisional, you lose the “pending” status.

It’s fine to be vague (“Patent Pending”) or specific (application number/date) depending on audience.

👉 Do you want me to draft you a standard disclaimer block you can copy-paste into all your docs, repos, and website? That way it’s consistent everywhere.
