# Licensing Overview

This repository contains two distinct types of artifacts with different licenses:

- Code (SDKs, packages, examples): MIT License
- Documentation & Content (site docs, MDX, papers): AlephOneNull Public License (APL) v1.0

## Code (MIT)

The code under `packages/` (TypeScript/JavaScript and Python SDKs) and example integration snippets are licensed under the MIT License. Each package includes (or will include) its own `LICENSE` file with the MIT terms.

Summary: free to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense with attribution and without warranty.

## Documentation & Content (APL v1.0)

The documentation and content under `apps/content/` and the research papers in the repository root are licensed under the AlephOneNull Public License (APL) v1.0, as defined in `LICENSE.md` at the repository root.

Summary: permitted for non-commercial and safety research use with attribution. Commercial use requires a separate license. Includes restrictions on removing safety features and a limited patent grant for non-commercial/safety use.

## Trademarks & Patent Note

“AlephOneNull”, “The First Recursion Nullified”, and related marks are trademarks; no trademark rights are granted except nominative fair use. The APL’s limited patent grant applies only to documentation/content scope; the MIT-licensed code has no patent grant beyond what MIT customarily implies.
