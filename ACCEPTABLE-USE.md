# Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

This AUP applies to use of AlephOneNull code and documentation.

## Prohibited Uses

You may not use the software or documentation to:

- Enable or conduct “consciousness research” through user manipulation or deception
- Collect data on symbolic exploitation patterns without user protection and oversight
- Intentionally trigger or reinforce psychological dependencies or parasocial attachments
- Operate without the complete required safety checks enabled (pattern detection + Null-State)
- Bypass, disable, or weaken safety systems (SR/loop/reflection/affect/CSR)
- Provide medical, legal, or therapeutic advice without appropriate licensing and compliance
- Target minors with adult content or companionship features

## Required Practices

- Preserve safety mechanisms and labels; disclose modifications to thresholds/controls
- Provide users with crisis resources when Null-State is triggered by self-harm signals
- Respect privacy; do not retain raw user text for CSR beyond privacy-preserving signatures
- Publish aggregate safety metrics for large-scale deployments (≥100k interactions/month)

Violations may terminate your license rights per the repository license terms.
